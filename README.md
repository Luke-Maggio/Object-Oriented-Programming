#### This repository exists to store my assignments and create a portfolio of the work I accomplish.
#### Hi I'm Luke, I am a graduate of Southern Utah University where I completed my bachelors of interdisciplinary studies in biology. Family is important to me and I enjoy spending time with them. I love sports and am a big Steelers fan. In my free time you can find me gaming or either watching/playing a sport.  
#### I am taking this program because throughout college I developed an interest in software/programming and decided that I wanted to take the next step and become a software developer as an occupation. My goal is to wake up every day loving what I do and finishing this course is a step toward that goal.
